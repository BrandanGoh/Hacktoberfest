# Choir Life
At the start of the year, we had a planned performance which was cancelled due to COVID-19.
Although we were all thoroughly disappointed, especially the Year 1s, we understood that personal health came first and that we could always try harder the next time.
On the bright side, this meant that we had an extra year to practise, so that we can perform even better next year!
